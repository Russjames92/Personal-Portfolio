                <h3>Hi! Thanks for Stopping By!</h3>
                <p>I was born, raised, and currently live in Northern California. I’ve been involved in a lot of
                    different things professionally. While I love to solve problems in a technical sense, my passions
                    are creative in nature.</p>

                <p>After graduating high-school at the young age of sixteen, I went on to college for both Opticianry
                    and music. Two very different worlds, but one was a job and the other a passion.</p>

                <p>My aim was to find something to combine a job and my passion. Thus I began pursuing Graphic Design
                    and now Software Development as a student at Thinkful. So far I love it. I’m really looking forward
                    to the many projects ahead.</p>

                <p>I’d love to work with you!</p>

                <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
                <p>I've worked in graphic design for the past 10 years or so.
                    I've also worked as a teacher of music, and am now studying to
                    learn software development. I felt my career skills would be much more
                    enhanced by learning software development.</p>

                <p>I've always been a bit of a perfectionist to fault. And I love to
                    create things. The fine detail of software development and the endless
                    possibilities when it comes to creating have been a perfect fit for me.
                    I'm super excited about the many projects I may encounter.
                </p>
